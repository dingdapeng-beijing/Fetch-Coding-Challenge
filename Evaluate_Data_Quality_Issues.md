# Data Quality Issues Identified in JSON Data

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Misaligned `user_id` in Receipts vs. Users
- **Issue**:
  - `user_id` values in the `Receipts` table may not always correspond to valid entries in the `Users` table.
  - This misalignment can lead to orphaned records and inaccurate reporting.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Every `user_id` in `Receipts` should have a corresponding entry in the `Users` collection.

---

#### 2. Inconsistent Date Handling
- **Issue**:
  - Dates are stored as `$date` objects with millisecond timestamps, creating potential parsing complexity for different systems.
  - Some fields, such as `purchaseDate`, might be missing or inconsistent across records.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - All date fields should follow a consistent structure and include complete data.

---

#### 3. Data Type Inconsistencies
- **Issue**:
  - `pointsEarned` is stored as a string (e.g., `"300.0"`) instead of a numeric type.
  - `totalSpent` is stored as a string (e.g., `"1.00"`) instead of a decimal or float.
  - Inconsistent representations can cause calculation and aggregation issues.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - All numeric fields should be stored as appropriate numeric types.

---

#### 4. Incomplete or Problematic Receipts
- **Issue**:
  - Some receipts have `purchasedItemCount` as 0, indicating no items purchased.
  - Certain receipts are flagged with `rewardsReceiptStatus` as `"FLAGGED"`.
  - Multiple entries have `needsFetchReview` set to `true`, requiring additional manual review.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Receipts should have at least one purchased item and clear guidelines for flagged statuses.

---

#### 5. Repeated or Redundant Data
- **Issue**:
  - In some receipts (e.g., ID `5ff1e1b40a7214ada100055b`), identical entries are repeated (e.g., 9 identical entries for Miller Lite).
  - Such duplication indicates potential issues in data processing or ingestion.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Each receipt should contain unique items, unless justified by metadata differences.

---

#### 6. Incomplete Item Information
- **Issue**:
  - Many items have `"ITEM NOT FOUND"` as their description.
  - Some items are marked as `userFlaggedNewItem: true`, indicating incomplete product information.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Items should have complete and accurate descriptions, and flagged items should undergo automated enrichment or review.

---

#### 7. Inconsistent Point Awarding
- **Issue**:
  - Some items include `pointsNotAwardedReason`, indicating unclear logic for points awarding.
  - Bonus point calculations appear inconsistent.
  - Certain entries prevent targeting point gaps with `preventTargetGapPoints: true`.
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Point awarding logic should be standardized, well-documented, and consistently applied.

---

### Recommendations to Address Data Quality Issues

#### 1. Data Standardization
- Normalize date formats to ensure consistent parsing across systems.
- Convert string-based numeric fields (e.g., `pointsEarned`, `totalSpent`) to proper numeric types.
- Implement strict type casting during data ingestion to prevent invalid or inconsistent data.

---

#### 2. Receipt Validation
- Implement validation rules to ensure:
  - `purchasedItemCount` is greater than zero.
  - Clear guidelines for handling receipts flagged with `"FLAGGED"` status.
- Develop automated review processes for user-flagged items (e.g., `needsFetchReview: true`).

---

#### 3. Item Data Enrichment
- Create fallback mechanisms for items with `"ITEM NOT FOUND"` descriptions.
- Develop processes to populate missing product descriptions using external data sources.
- Implement barcode/product lookup services to enrich item information during ingestion.

---

#### 4. Points and Rewards Logic
- Standardize point calculation rules across all receipts and items.
- Create clear documentation for conditions under which points are awarded or withheld (e.g., `pointsNotAwardedReason`).
- Develop consistent handling for edge cases like `preventTargetGapPoints`.

---

#### 5. Data Integrity Checks
- Implement database constraints (e.g., foreign key checks for `user_id` in `Receipts` against `Users`).
- Create validation layers in ETL processes to flag duplicate or suspicious entries.
- Develop monitoring systems to identify and resolve data anomalies, such as repeated items in receipts.

---

### Summary
By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure data consistency, reduce manual interventions, and improve the overall reliability of the system.
