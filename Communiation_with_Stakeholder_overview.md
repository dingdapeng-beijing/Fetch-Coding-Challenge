# Communicating Data Quality Issues to Stakeholders

## Subject: Key Data Insights and Recommendations  

Hi Team,  

I’ve reviewed the provided data and identified a few key issues that may affect its reliability. Below is a summary of findings and recommendations tailored to ensure we maintain data quality while scaling for future needs.

### Key Findings
1. **User and Receipt Mismatch:** Some receipts don’t match valid users. We need to confirm if all receipts should be tied to existing users.
2. **Inconsistent Dates:** Dates like `purchaseDate` sometimes appear out of order (e.g., scanned before purchase). Clear rules for date relationships are needed.
3. **Data Type Issues:** Fields like `pointsEarned` and `totalSpent` are stored as text instead of numbers, which can cause calculation problems.
4. **Problematic Receipts:** Some receipts have zero items or flagged statuses that need review.
5. **Duplicate Entries:** Items like Miller Lite appear multiple times in one receipt, which seems redundant.
6. **Incomplete Items:** Many items are labeled as `"ITEM NOT FOUND"`, leading to gaps in product data.

### Recommendations
1. **Define Rules:** Establish clear expectations for user-receipt links, date sequences, and flagged statuses.
2. **Standardize Data Types:** Convert text-based numeric fields into proper numbers to ensure accurate calculations.
3. **Enrich Missing Data:** Use external sources to fill in incomplete product information (e.g., `"ITEM NOT FOUND"`).
4. **Automate Validation:** Add checks during data ingestion to catch errors like duplicates, invalid dates, and missing fields.
5. **Optimize for Scale:** Use indexing and pre-aggregated metrics to improve query performance as the dataset grows.

### Next Steps
Let’s align on the rules for handling flagged receipts, validating item descriptions, and setting up data checks. Once clarified, we can implement automated solutions to prevent these issues in the future.  

Let me know if we can schedule a discussion to prioritize these actions!  

Best regards,
